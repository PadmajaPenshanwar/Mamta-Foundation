            <h2> Why HIV Positive Child ?</h2>
           
            <p>Lack of awareness about HIV and AIDS leads to rejection from main stream society. India registered 5.7 million cases in 2007. Maharashtra ranked 4th in India and Pune scored 2nd in the state. Rehabilitation facilities for such children are not in proportion to the increasing number of registered cases. Hence our primary aim is to increase the life span by providing high protein diet, nutritional support and medical treatment, bring them in the main stream by providing basic education and exposure to society, provide rehabilitation, community health, women empowerment and spreading awareness and enabling social acceptance. We create an atmosphere of love, care, happiness and understanding for each child to ensure physical, emotional and overall development.</p>
